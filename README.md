## About the Repository

This repo reflects my journey as a self-taught developer studying mathematics and applied programming.

It includes structured coursework-based exercises, hands-on problem solving, and exploratory math projects developed independently.

## Study Sources

-   [Mike X. Cohen – Linear Algebra (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-theory-and-implementation/)

-   [Mike X. Cohen – Statistics & Machine Learning (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/statsml_x/)

These courses emphasize a dual focus on **mathematical understanding** and **Python implementation**.

## Highlights

From the most recent Jupyter notebooks:

-   [**Least Squares Modeling and Analysis**](https://github.com/andrewblais/mathWithPython/blob/main/linearAlgebra/la018_lst_sq.ipynb) — Takes mock data, builds a Least Squares model, visualizes and evaluates the results.

-   [**QR Decomposition: Manipulation, Inverse, Validation**](https://github.com/andrewblais/mathWithPython/blob/main/linearAlgebra/la017_qr_dcmp_inv.ipynb) — Take the Identity Matrix and add/subtract a Rank 1 Matrix (formed from two vectors) of — _a.k.a._ a Rank-1 Update. Factor with QR decomposition, reconstruct, verify the inverse. Run numerical and visual checks.

-   [**Gram-Schmidt Procedure**](https://github.com/andrewblais/mathWithPython/blob/main/linearAlgebra/la016_gram_schmidt.ipynb) — Generating an orthonormal matrix manually through sequential vector projection and column vector subtraction.

-   [**PDFs vs. CDFs**](https://github.com/andrewblais/mathWithPython/blob/main/statsMachineLearning/sml013_pdf_cdf.ipynb) — Building intuition around a probability density function and its cumulative distribution function through visualization.

-   [**Probability vs Odds**](https://github.com/andrewblais/mathWithPython/blob/main/statsMachineLearning/sml012_prob_odds.ipynb) — Interactive explanation of odds vs probability, useful for classification models.

-   [**Z-scores vs Trimmed Means**](https://github.com/andrewblais/mathWithPython/blob/main/statsMachineLearning/sml011_z_vs_trim.ipynb) — Compare robustness of standard vs trimmed methods in outlier removal.
