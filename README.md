## **_About:_**

Math exercises paralleling my coursework in Linear Algebra and Statistics/Machine Learning, both the theory and implementation via Python.

## **_Repo Note:_**

-   This repository is broken into a few main parts:

    -   `./linearAlgebra`

        -   Consists of exercises/problems based directly or closely extrapolating on my studies in Linear Algebra.

            -   See [Mike X. Cohen's](https://www.mikexcohen.com/) Linear Algebra course at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-theory-and-implementation).

    -   `./statsMachineLearning`

        -   Consists of exercises/problems based directly or closely extrapolating on my studies of Statistics and Machine Learning.

            -   See [Mike X. Cohen's](https://www.mikexcohen.com/) Statistics/Machine Learning course at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/statsml_x).

    -   `./variousProjects`

        -   Stuff I created from my brain.
