## About the Repository

This repo reflects homework/practice/projects I worked on as a self-taught developer learning mathematics and applied programming.

It includes structured coursework-based exercises, hands-on problem solving, and exploratory math projects developed independently.

## Study Sources

-   [Mike X. Cohen – Linear Algebra (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-theory-and-implementation/)

-   [Mike X. Cohen – Statistics & Machine Learning (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/statsml_x/)

These courses emphasize a dual focus on **mathematical understanding** and **Python implementation**.

## Highlights

From the most recent Jupyter notebooks:

-   [**Manual Eigendecomposition, $2 \times 2$ Case**](https://github.com/andrewblais/mathWithPython/blob/main/linearAlgebra/la020_manual_eig_2x2.ipynb) -- Generates a clean random $2 \times 2$ matrix. Computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors manually. Verifies the results via `numpy.linalg.eig()`.

-   [**Visualizing the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem**](https://github.com/andrewblais/mathWithPython/blob/main/statsMachineLearning/sml014_lln_clt.ipynb) -- Analyzes several distributions to demonstrate and visualize the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.

-   [**Complex Eigenvalue Art**](https://github.com/andrewblais/mathWithPython/blob/main/linearAlgebra/la019_complex_eigvalue_art.ipynb) -- Harvests complex eigenvalues from random matrices. Makes something funky.

-   [**Least Squares Modeling and Analysis**](https://github.com/andrewblais/mathWithPython/blob/main/linearAlgebra/la018_lst_sq.ipynb) -- Takes mock data, builds a Least Squares model, visualizes and evaluates the results.

-   [**QR Decomposition: Manipulation, Inverse, Validation**](https://github.com/andrewblais/mathWithPython/blob/main/linearAlgebra/la017_qr_dcmp_inv.ipynb) -- Take the Identity Matrix and add/subtract a Rank 1 Matrix (formed from two vectors) of -- _a.k.a._ a Rank-1 Update. Factor with QR decomposition, reconstruct, verify the inverse. Run numerical and visual checks.

## About Me

A self-taught, full-time student focused on Software Development, Mathematics, and AI Saftey Theory.

-   Studying since 2022 -- developing fluency in Python and progressing rapidly in JavaScript and $\Rightarrow$ math, data science and full-stack dev.
-   Passionate about **AI Alignment and Safety**.
-   Open to internships, junior dev roles, and meaningful collaboration.
-   Trying to continually learn -- from bootcamps, online documentation/materials/books, and building real things.
